## Write with markdown
Duration: 5

Create a file named `my-codelab.md`. Open this file with your favorite editor (most of them have Markdown syntax hightlighting)

On the top of the file, add some metadata about the codelab (id, summary, category, authors, etc.).
With the first level Markdown `heading`, define the name of the codelab.

Then use second level Markdown `heading` to defined the codelab structure and the different steps.

`Duration` is a metadata to give an estimated duration of each step.

Finally, the third level Markdown `heading` defines different chapters in a step.

You can find the [complete Codelab Formatting Guide](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/master/FORMAT-GUIDE.md) explaining a codelab structure in markdown.

Lot of features are available, you can:
- add code snippets
- use hyperlinks
- embed images

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Generate HTML
Duration: 5

We will use claat (Codelabs as a Thing) to generate HTML files from our Markdown file.
To avoid installing `Go`, I made a light docker image to use claat.

First install the image:
```docker
docker pull bpetetot/claat
```

Execute claat:
```docker
docker container run -it -v $(pwd):/app bpetetot/claat export my-codelab.md
```

**You now have generate the codelab as HTML.**

When you are working on the codelab, you can serve it on localhost:
```docker
docker container run -it -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd):/app bpetetot/claat serve -addr 0.0.0.0:9090 my-codelab.md
```

## Deploy it
Duration: 1

Now you have a full HTML static codelab, you can deploy it with your hosting provider:
- GitHub pages
- Netlify
- Now.sh
- Firebase hosting

**Now you can create amazing codelabs and documentation. ðŸŽ‰**
